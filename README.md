# Caesar Cipher

This is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher, a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. 

*The Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encrypting text, used by Julius Caesar to communicate secretly with his officials.*

## How to Use

1. Run the script.
2. When prompted, type `encode` to encrypt a message or `decode` to decrypt a message.
3. Enter your message.
4. Enter the shift number (an integer).

The script will then output the encoded or decoded result.
